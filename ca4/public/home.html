            This website was built using node.js, JavaScript and HTML.
            Node provides the boilerplate code with express and socket.
            Node is modular in design as node package manager allows developers
            to integrate other packages into their software for increased utility programatically and in design.

            By using npm I've been able to implement Argon2, which is a hashing library that won the 2015 Password Hashing Competition.
            There are two versions of this library, Argon2i and Argon2d.
            <br>
            <br>
            Argon2i is optimised for side-channel attacks.
            <br>
            <br>
            Argon2d is optimised for GPU cracking attacks.
            <br>
            <br>
            I chose to use Argon2id which is a combination of both, literally in hashing, the first pass is Argon2i and the rest
            of the passes use Argon2d.
            <br>
            <br>
            This doesn't eliminate side-channel attacks but does significantly reduce the ease.
            I had originally attempted to use scrypt which is deprecated, then I actually attempted bcrypt. I then settled 
            for Argon2.

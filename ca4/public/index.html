        <p>

            My main focus on this task was on the backend of the website. My primary goal was to implement a sign-up
            and login system, as I hadn't done that previously and believed that to be an interesting challenge. 
            My original idea was to create a HTML form in both login and sign-up pages, which would be posted
            to the backend, as I had done this previously but in flask.
            <br>
            <br>
            However, I kept running into an issue with express not getting the post requests. Im not sure what the issue 
            was or how I resolved it but it currently works on my set-up. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Once the data was posted to the backend, it would encrypt the users email and password using originally scrypt.
            But after several days of attempting to get scrypt implemented I gave up and read the documentation which stated 
            that scrypt is deprecated. I then decided to implement encryption using Argon2, which was comparatively easy to do.
            Ideally you don't want the users details to be send via plaintext, but with time now being restricted I decided 
            not to peruse a TLS or client-server encryption. So the details are sent plaintext. 
            <br>
            <br>
            If the user is signing up, the info is posted to the server captured by express which invokes a function to 
            encrypt the information and write that to a text file.
            If the user is logging in, the details are verified using a built-in Argon function, and if authentication is 
            successful the user is shown the chat page.
            <br>
            <br>
            This isn't the most secure method as someone could change the URL to the chat page and get in fine. I would 
            like to implement proper HTTP request and response functions to prevent that, along with giving logged in 
            users cookies to prevent re-logging in after refresh, and giving chat users names, but again time was an issue.
            But to my knowledge my Argon2 implementation works well. 
            <br>
            <br>
            There might be an issue with Argon2 not liking running on an x86 device, as this was developed on arm
            the solution seems to be to delete the Argon2 package in node_modules and re-download it by:
            <br>
            npm install argon2 --save
            <br>
            <br>
            The username and password for the login is a@b.com password
        </p>
